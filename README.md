# CS615_Sentence_Similarity_Project
Machine Learning Project of Semester 6  at PDPM IIITDM Jabalpur. 
Since large sentences can be easily know whether they are similar are not by length of the sentence and the frequency and overlap of the words in the sentences , we need to find the similarity between small texts . This is done by the approach given above . 
As we put more restrictions on the composite feature , the fewer times it occurs in the corpus ; however, some of the more restrictive features are most effective in determining similarity.

PROCEDURE:-
Each of the file explains a given method which is independent. Except Final.py, all are some functions which may/may not be present in the Final code. Run other files to understand the functionality of libraries used. Final.py if you want to see the result directly.
